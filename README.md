# *Caravan-Qual*: A global scale integration of water quality observations into a large-sample hydrology dataset

Caravan-Qual is an open access dataset that brings water quality to the research paradigm of large sample hydrology (LSH), integrating daily water quality data from 100 constituents with catchment attributes, meterological forcing and co-located streamflow observations.

The dataset is currently under submission at Scientific Data [ADD LINK TO PREPRINT].

This repository contains the code for recreating or extending the *Caravan-Qual* dataset.

The original Caravan paper can be accessed here, while developments and community extensions are documented on Caravan's GitHub page.
